You can get up and running very quichkly by submitting photos and scans to the most appropriate prebuilt model.

- **Analyze forms by using financial, ID, and tax prebuilt models.**

## Several Prebuilt Models

- **Receipt model** : Extracts common fields and their values from receipts.
  W2 model. Extracts common fields and their values from the US Government's W2 tax declaration form.

- **Health insurance card model** : Extracts common fields and their values from health insurance cards.

## Input Requirements

The prebuilt models are very flexible but you can help them to return accurate and helpful results by submitting one clear photo or high-quality scan for each document.

You must also comply with these requirements when you submit a form for analysis:

- The file must be in JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, or PDF format. Additionally, the Read model can accept Microsoft Office files.
- The file must be smaller than 500 MB for the standard tier, and 4 MB for the free tier.
- Images must have dimensions between 50 x 50 pixels and 10,000 x 10,000 pixels.
- PDF documents must have dimensions less than 17 x 17 inches or A3 paper size.
- PDF documents must not be protected with a password.

# Knowledge Check

1. You have a large set of documents with varying structures that contain customer name and address information. You want to extract entities for each customer. Which prebuilt model should you use?

- [x] **General Document Model**. is the only one that supports **entity extraction**.

2. You are using the prebuilt layout model to analyze a document with many checkboxes. You want to find out whether each box is checked or empty. What object should you use in the returned JSON code?

- [x] **Selection Marks**. record checkboxes and radio buttons and include whether they're selected or not.

3. You submit a Word document to the Azure AI Document Intelligence general document model for analysis but you receive an error. The file is A4 size, contains 1 MB of data, and is not password-protected. How should you resolve the error?

- [x] Convert the document to PDF Format. Word documents are not supported by Azure AI Document Intelligence but PDF documents are supported. Azure AI is designed to analyze scanned and photographed paper documents, not documents that are already in a digital format so you should consider using another technology to extract the data in Word Documents.
