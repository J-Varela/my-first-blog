## Unit 2

# Understand prebuild capabilites of the Azure AI Language service

The Azure AI Language service provides various features for understanding human language. You can use each feature to better communicate with users, better understand incoming communication, or use them together to provide more insight into what the user is saying, indtending, and asking about.

Azure AI Language service features fall into two categories: Pre-configured features, and Learned features. Learned Features require building and training a model to correctly predict appropriate labels, which is covered in upcoming unit of this module.

This unit covers most of the capabilites of the Azure AI Language service, but head over to the Azure AI Language service documentation for a full list, including quickstarts and a full explanation of everything available.

Using these features in your app requires sending your query to the appropriate endpoint. The endpoint used to query a specific feature varies, but all of them are prefixed with the Azure AI Language resource you created in you Azure account, either when building your REST request or defining your client using an SDK. Examples of each can be found in the next unit.

# Pre-Configured features

The Azure AI Language service provides certain features without any model labeling or training. Once you create your resource, you can send your data and use the returned results within your app.

The following features are all pre-configured.

## Sumarization

Summarization is available for both documents and conversations, and will summarize the text into key sentences that are predicted to encapsulate the input's meaning.

## Named entity recognition

Named entity recognition can extract and identify entities, such as people, places, or companies, allowing your app to recognize different types of entities for improved natural language responses. For example, given the text "The waterfront pier is my favorite Seattle attraction", Seattle would be identified and categorized as a location.

## Personally identifiable information (PII) detection

PII detection allows you to identify, categorize, and redact information that could be considered sensitive, such as email addresses, home addresses, IP addresses, names, and protected health information. For example, if the text "email@yahoo.com" was included in the query, the entire email address can be identified and redacted.

## Key phrase extraction

Key phrase extraction is a feature that quickly pulls the main concepts out of the porvided text. For example, given the text "Text analytics is one of the features in Azure AI Services", the service would extract "Azure AI Services" and "Text Analytics".

## Sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis identifies how positive or negative a string or document is. For example, given the text "Great hotel. Close to plenty of food and attraction we could walk to", the service would identify that as positive with a relatively high confidence score.

## Language detection

Language detection takes one or more documents, and identifies the language for each. For example, if the text of one of the documents was "Bonjour", the service would identify that as French.

## Learned features

Learned features require you to label data, train, and deploy your model to make it available to use in your applicaiton. These features allow you to customize what information is predicted or extracted.

# Knowledge check

1. Your app must interpret a command such as "turn on the light" or "switch the light on". What do these phrases represent in a language model?

- [x] **Utterances.**

2. Your app must interpret a command to book a flight to a specified city, such as "Book a flight to Paris". How should you model the city element of the command?

- [x] As an **enitity.**

3. Your language model needs to detect and email when present in an utterance. What is the simplest way to extract that email?

- [x] Use **_prebuilt entity components_**.

## study these key phrases!!!

In this module, you learned how to create a conversational language understanding model.

- Provision an Azure AI Language resource.
- Define **_intents, entities and utterances_**
- Use patterns to differentiate similar utterances.
- Use pre-built entity components
- Train, test, publish, and review a model.
