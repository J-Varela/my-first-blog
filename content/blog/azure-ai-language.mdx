## Unit 1

# Introduction

Every day, the world generates a vast quantity of data; much of it text-based in the form of emails, social media posts, online reviews, business documents, and more. Artificial Intelligence techniques that apply statistical and semantic models enable you to create applications that extract meaning and insights from this text-based data.

The **Azure AI Language** provides an **API** for common text analysis techniques that you can easily integrate into your own application code.

In this module, you will learn how to use Azure AI Language to:

- **_Detect Language from text_**.
- **_Analyze text sentiment_**
- **_Extract key phrases, entities, and linked entities_**.

## Unit 2

# Provision an Azure AI Language resource

**_Azure AI Language_** is designed to help you extract information from text. It provides functionality that you can use for:

- **_Language detection_** - determining the language in which text is written.

- **_Key phrase extraction_** - identifying important words and phrases in the text that indicate the main points.

- **_Sentiment analysis_** - quantifying how positive or negative the text is.

- **_Named entity recognition_** - detecting references to entities, including people, locations, time periods, organizations, and more.

- **_Entity linking_** - identifying specific entities by providing references links to Wikipedia articles.

# Azure resources for text analysis

To use Azure AI Language to analyze text, you must provision a resource for it in your Azure Subscription.

After you have provisioned a suitable resource in your Azure Subscription, you can use its **_endpoint_** and one of its **_keys_** to call the Azure AI Language APIs from your code. You can call the Azure AI Language APIs by submitting requests in JSON format to REST interface, or by using any of the available programming language-specific SDKs.

## Unit 3

# Detect Language

The **_Azure AI Language_** detection **_API_** evaluates **_text_** input and, for each documents submitted, _returns_ **_language identifiers_** with a score indicating the strength of the analysis.

This capability is **useful** for **_content stores_** that **_collect_** _arbitrary_ **text**, where **language** _is unkown_. Another scenario could involve a chat bot. If a user starts a session with the chat bot, **language detection** can be _use_ to **determine which language** they are **using** and allow you to configure your bot **_responses_** in the **appropriate language**.

You can **parse the results** of this **analysis** to **determine which language** is **used** in the **input document**. The response also returns a **score**, which reflects the **confidence** of **the model** (a value between 0 and 1).

**_Language detection_** can work with **documents** or **_single phrases_**. It's important to note that the **_document size_** must be **under** **_5,120_** **characters**. The **_size limit_** is **_per document_** and **each collection** is **_restricted to 1,000 items_**. (IDs). A sample of a properly **formatted JSON payload** that you might submit to the service in the request body is shown here, including a **_collection_** of **documents**, each **containing** a **_unique id_** and the **text** to be **_analyzed_**. Optionally, you can **provide** a **_countryHint_** to **_improve prediction performance_**.

```json
{
  "kind": "LanguageDetection",
  "parameters": {
    "modelVersion": "latest"
  },
  "analysisInput": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "text": "Hello world",
        "countryHint": "US"
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "text": "Bonjour tout le monde"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The service will return a JSON response that contains a result for each **document** in the request body, **including the predicted language** and a **_value_** indicating the **_confidence level_** of the _prediction_. The **_confidence level_** is a **_value_** ranging from 0 to 1 with _values_ closer to 1 being a _higher confidence level_. Here's an example of a standard **JSON response** that maps to the above **request JSON**.

```json
{
  "kind": "LanguageDetectionResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "detectedLanguage": {
          "confidenceScore": 1,
          "iso6391Name": "en",
          "name": "English"
        },
        "id": "1",
        "warnings": []
      },
      {
        "detectedLanguage": {
          "confidenceScore": 1,
          "iso6391Name": "fr",
          "name": "French"
        },
        "id": "2",
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
  }
}
```

In our sample, all of the languages show a confidence of 1, mostly because the text is relatively simple and easy to identify the language for.

If you pass in a document that has **_multilingual content_**, the service will behave a bit differently. Mixed language content within the same document returns the language with the largest representation in the content, but with a **lower positive rating**, reflecting the marginal strength of that assesment. In the **following example**, the input is a blend of English, Spanish, and French. The **analyzer** uses statistical **analysis** of the text to determine the **_predominant language_**.

```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. ¿Se ofrecen clases en español? Es mi primera lengua y más fácil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en français?"
    }
  ]
}
```

The **following** sample shows a **response** for this multi-language example.

```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "detectedLanguage": {
        "name": "Spanish",
        "iso6391Name": "es",
        "confidenceScore": 0.9375
      },
      "warnings": []
    }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
}
```

The last condition to consider is when there is ambiguity as to the language content. The scenario might happen if you submit textual content that the analyzer is not able to parse, for example because of character encoding issues when converting the text to a string variable. As a result, the **response** for the **language name** and **ISO** code will indicate (unknown) and the **score value** will be **_returned_** as 0. The following example shows how the response would look.

```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "detectedLanguage": {
        "name": "(Unknown)",
        "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",
        "confidenceScore": 0.0
      },
      "warnings": []
    }
  ],
  "errors": [],
  "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
}
```

## Unit 4

# Extract key phrases

**_Key phrase extraction_** is the **process** of evaluating the text of a document, or documents, and then **_identifying_** the main points around the context of the document(s).

**_Key phrase extraction_** works best for larger documents (the maximum size that can be analyzed is 5,120 characters).

As with **language detection**, the **_REST interface_** **enables** you to submit one or more documents for analysis.

```json
{
    "kind": "KeyPhraseExtraction",
    "parameters": {
        "modelVersion": "latest"
    },
    "analysisInput":{
        "documents":[
            {
              "id": "1",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "You must be the change you wish
                       to see in the world."
            },
            {
              "id": "2",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "The journey of a thousand miles
                       begins with a single step."
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The **response** contains a **_list of key phrases_** detected **_in each document_**.

```json
{
  "kind": "KeyPhraseExtractionResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "keyPhrases": ["change", "world"],
        "warnings": []
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "keyPhrases": ["miles", "single step", "journey"],
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2021-06-01"
  }
}
```

## Unit 5

# Analyze sentiment

**_Sentiment analysis_** is used to **evaluate** how **_positive or negative_** a text document is, which can be useful in various workloads, such as:

- Evaluating a movie, book, or product by quantifying sentiment **_based on reviews_**.
- Prioritizing **_customer service_** responses to correspondence received through email or social media messaging.

When using **Azure AI Language** to **_evaluate sentiment_**, the response includes **_overall document sentiment_** and **individual sentence sentiment** for each document submitted to the **service**.

For example, you could submit a single document for sentiment analysis like this:

```json
{
  "kind": "SentimentAnalysis",
  "parameters": {
    "modelVersion": "latest"
  },
  "analysisInput": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "language": "en",
        "text": "Good morning!"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The _response_ from the service might look like this:

```json
{
  "kind": "SentimentAnalysisResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "sentiment": "positive",
        "confidenceScores": {
          "positive": 0.89,
          "neutral": 0.1,
          "negative": 0.01
        },
        "sentences": [
          {
            "sentiment": "positive",
            "confidenceScores": {
              "positive": 0.89,
              "neutral": 0.1,
              "negative": 0.01
            },
            "offset": 0,
            "length": 13,
            "text": "Good morning!"
          }
        ],
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-11-01"
  }
}
```

**_Sentence sentiment_** is based on _confidence_ scores for **positive, negative, and neutral** classification values between 0 and 1.

Overall document sentiment is based on sentences:

- if all sentences are neutral, the overall sentiment is neutral.
- if sentence classifications include only positive and neutral, the overall sentiments is positive.
- If the sentence classification include only negative and neutral, the overall sentiment is negative.
- If the sentence classification inlude positive and negative, the overall sentiment is mixed.

## Unit 6

# Extract entities

Named **Entity Recognition** identifies entities that are **mentioned** in the **_text_**. Entities are **grouped** into **categories** and **subcategories**, for example:

- Person
- Location
- DateTime
- Organization
- Address
- Email
- URL

Input for entity recognition is similar to input for other Azure AI Language API functions:

```json
{
  "kind": "EntityRecognition",
  "parameters": {
    "modelVersion": "latest"
  },
  "analysisInput": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "language": "en",
        "text": "Joe went to London on Saturday"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The response includes a list of categorized entities found in each document:

```json
{
  "kind": "EntityRecognitionResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "entities": [
          {
            "text": "Joe",
            "category": "Person",
            "offset": 0,
            "length": 3,
            "confidenceScore": 0.62
          },
          {
            "text": "London",
            "category": "Location",
            "subcategory": "GPE",
            "offset": 12,
            "length": 6,
            "confidenceScore": 0.88
          },
          {
            "text": "Saturday",
            "category": "DateTime",
            "subcategory": "Date",
            "offset": 22,
            "length": 8,
            "confidenceScore": 0.8
          }
        ],
        "id": "1",
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2021-01-15"
  }
}
```

## Unit 7

# Extract linked entities

In some createSecureServer, the same name might be applicable to more than one entity. For example, does an **instance** of the word "Venus" refer to the planet of the goddess from mythology?

**_Entity_** linking can be used to **disambiguate entities** of the **same name by referencing an article** in a knowledge base for the **Text analytics service. Specific article **links\*\* are determined based on entity context within the text.

For example, \_"I saw Venus shining in the sky" is associated with the link

```mdx
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus
```

while "validateLocaleAndSetLanguage, the goddess of beauty" is associated with

```mdx
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology)
```

As with all Azure AI Language service functions, you can submit one or more documents for analysis.

```json
{
  "kind": "EntityLinking",
  "parameters": {
    "modelVersion": "latest"
  },
  "analysisInput": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "language": "en",
        "text": "I saw Venus shining in the sky"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The **response** includes the **entities identified** in the text along with links to associated article:

```json
{
  "kind": "EntityLinkingResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "entities": [
          {
            "bingId": "89253af3-5b63-e620-9227-f839138139f6",
            "name": "Venus",
            "matches": [
              {
                "text": "Venus",
                "offset": 6,
                "length": 5,
                "confidenceScore": 0.01
              }
            ],
            "language": "en",
            "id": "Venus",
            "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus",
            "dataSource": "Wikipedia"
          }
        ],
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2021-06-01"
  }
}
```
