# 1. Prepare to Develop AI Solutions on Microsoft Azure

As an aspiring **_Azure AI Engineer_**, you **UNDERSTAND CORE CONCEPTS** and **principles of AI** development, and the capabilities of **_Azure services_** used in AI Solutions.

## Knowledge Check

1. Which of the following **best describes the prediction made by a Machine learning Model?**

- [x] Machine learning models are trained using historic data, and rely on algorithms that find statistical relationships in the data. **Predictions are generally based on probability**; and while models are often extremely accurate, predictions are **based on a confidence score that indicates a level of probability**.

2. A data scientist has used Azure Machine Learning to **train a machine learning model**. **How can you use the Model in your application?**

- [x] You can **use Azure Machine Learning to publish a trained model as a web service**, and consume it from application through its REST interface.

3. You want to **index a collection of text documents**, and **search them** from a mobile application. **Which service** should you use to create the index?.

- [x] **Use Azure AI Search** to index documents for search.

# 2. Create and Manage Azure AI Services

Azure AI services enable developers to easily add AI Capabilities into their applications. **Learn how to create and Cosume these Services**.

1. How are client applications typically **granted access** to an **_Azure AI Services endpoint?_**

- [x] By default, access to an Azure AI Services resource is based on a **subscription key**.

2. In **which format are message exhanged between a client app** and an **Azure AI Services resource** when **using a REST API?**

- [x] Client apps submit **JSON requests and receive JSON responses**.

# 3. Secure AI Services

Securing Azure AI Services can help prevent data loss and privacy violations for user data that may be a part of the solution

1. You need to **generate the primary subscription key for an Azure AI Services Resource** that an appp use. What should **you do first to minimize service interruption for the app?**

- [x] The app can **use the secondary key to access the resource**.

2. You want to **store the subscription keys** for an Azure AI Services resource securely, so that **authorized apps can retrieve them** when needed. **What kind of Azure Resource should you provision?**

- [x] Use **Azure key Vault** to store credentials securely.

3. When running code on your computer that connects to Azure AI Services, you receive an error that access is denied **due to Virtual Network / Firewall rules** What Configuration do you need to set in the Azure Services Instance?

- [x] In **Networking properties,** add your **client IP address** to the **Firewall allowed List**.

# 4. Monitor Azure AI Services

Azure AI Services enable you to integrate artifical intelligence into your application and services. It's important to be able to monitor Azure AI Services in order to track utilization, determine trends, and detect and troubleshoot issues.

1. How should you **collect telemetry** for your Azure AI Services resource for **later analysis**?

- [x] **Diagnostic settings** enable you to capture data for subsequent analysis.

2. You are defining an alert that notifies you when a key regeneration event is recorded in the activity log for your Azure AI Services Resource. What should you do?

- [x] Specify a Condition with a **Signal Type of Activity Log.**

3. You are viewing a metric for your Azure AI Services resource in a chart. You want to combine the chart with visualizations of other resources and data. What should you do?

- [x] Add the Chart to a **Dashboard**.

# 5. Investigate Container for Use with AI Services

Learn about **Container support in Azure AI Services** allowing the use of **APIs** available in Azure and enable flexibility in where to deploy and host the services with **Docker Containers**.

1. You plan to use an Azure AI Services container in a local Docker host.
   Which of the following statements is true?

- [x] The container must be able to **connect** to the **Azure AI Services Resource Endpoint** to **send usage data for billing**.

2. Which of the following parameters must you specify when deploying as Azure AI Services container image?

- [x] **EULA**. You must specify a EULA parmaeter with the value "yes" to explicitly accept the licences agreement.

3. You plan to use the language detection functionality of Azure AI Language in a container. Which container image should you deploy?

- [x] **mcr.microsoft.com/azure-ai-services/textanalytics/language**
