## Unit 1

# Learning Objectives

After completing this module, **you'll be able to**:

- Provision a Translator Service
- Understand language detection, translation, and transileration
- Specify translation
- Define custom translations

## Unit 2

# Provision an Azure AI Translator resource

**Azure AI Translator** provides a multilingual text translation API that you can use for:

- Language detection.
- One-to-many translation.
- Script transileration (converting text from its native script to an alternative script).

# Azure Resource for Azure AI Translator

To use the **Azure AI Translator** service, you must provision a resource for it in your Azure Subscription. You can porvision a single-service Azure AI Translator resource, or you can use the **Text analytics API** in a **multi-service Azure AI services resorce**

After you have provisioned a suitable resource in your Azure Subscription, you can use the **location** where you deployed the resource and one of its **subscription keys** to call the **Azure AI Translator APIs** from your code. You can call the APIs by submitting requests in JSON format to the REST interface, or by using any of the available programming language-specific **SDKs**.

## Unit 3

# Understand Language detection, translation, and transileration

Let's explore the capabilities of **Azure AI Translator**. These capabilities include:

## Language detection

You can use **Detect** function of the **REST API** to detect the language in which text is written.

Here's the text want to translate:

```json
{ "Text": "こんにちは" }
```

# Translation

To translate text from one language to another, use the **Translate function**; specifying a single from parameter to indicate the source language, and one or more to parameters to sepcify the languages into which you want the text translated.

For example, you could submit the same JSON we previously used to detect the language, specifying a from parameter of **ja** (Japanese) and two to parmaters with the values **en** (English) and **fr** (French). To do this, you'd call:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/translate?api-version=3.0&from=ja&to=fr&to=en" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region: <your-service-region>" -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8" -d "[{ 'Text' : 'こんにちは' }]"

```

# Transileration

Our Japanese text is written using Hiragana script, so rather than translate it to a different language, you may want to transilerate it to a different script - for example to render the text in **_Latin script_** (as used by English language text).

To accomplish this, we can submit the Japanese text to the **Transilerate function** with a **fromScript** parameter of **Jpan** and a **toScript** parameter of **Latn**:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/transliterate?api-version=3.0&fromScript=Jpan&toScript=Latn" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region: <your-service-region>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "[{ 'Text' : 'こんにちは' }]"

```

## Unit 4

# Specify Translation options

The **Translate function** of the API **supports numerous parameters** that affect the output.

# Word alignment

In written English (using Latin script), spaces are used to separate words. However, in some other languages (and more specifically, scripts) this is not always the case.

For example, translating **"Smart Services"** from en(English) to zh(Simplified Chinese) produces the result "智能服务", and it's difficult to understand the relationship between the characters in the source text and the corresponding character in the translation. To resolve this problem, you can specify in **includedAlignment** parameter with a value of true in your call to produce the following result:

```json
[
  {
    "translations": [
      {
        "text": "智能服务",
        "to": "zh-Hans",
        "alignment": {
          "proj": "0:4-0:1 6:13-2:3"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

These results tell us that characters 0 to 4 in the source correspond to character 0 to 1 in the translation, while chracters 6 to 13 in the source correspond to character 2 to 3 in the translation.

# Sentence length

Sometimes it might be useful to know the length of a translation, for example to determine how best to display it ina user **interface**. You can get this information by setting the **includeSenteceLength** parameter to true.

For example, specifying this parameter when translating the English (en) text "Hello world" to French(fr) produces the following results:

```json
[
  {
    "translations": [
      {
        "text": "Salut tout le monde",
        "to": "fr",
        "sentLen": { "srcSentLen": [12], "transSentLen": [20] }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

# Profanity filtering

Sometimes text contains profanities, which you might want to obscure or omit altogeteher in **translation**. You can handle profanities by specifying the **profanityAction** parameter, which can have one of the following values:

- **NoAction:** Profanities are translated along with the rest of the text.
- **Deleted**: Profanites are omitted in the translation.
- **Marked**: Profanites are indicated using the technique indicated in the **profanityMarker** parameter (if supplied).
  The default value for this parameter is **Asterisk**, which replaces characters in profanites with , As an alternative, you can specify a profanityMarker value of Tag which causes profanites to be enclosed in XML tags.

# Knowledge Check

1. What function of Azure AI Translator should you use to convert the Chinese word "" to the English word "Hello"?

- [x] **Translate**. Translation converts text from one language to another.

2. What function of Azure AI Translator should you use to convert the Russian word "" in Cryllic characters to :: Latin characters?

- [x] **Translirate**. Transileration converts text from one script to another.
