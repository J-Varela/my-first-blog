# Introduction

Face detection, analysis and recognition are all common computer vision challenges for AI Systems. The ability to dtect when a person is present, identify a person's facial location, or recognize an individual based on their facial features is a key way in which AI systems can exhibit human-like behavior and build empathy with users.

In this module, you'll learn how to detect, analyze, and recognize faces using Azure AI Services.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify options for face detection analysis.
- Describe considerations for face analysis.
- Detect faces with the Azure AI Vision service.
- Understand the capabilities of the Face service.
- Learn about facial recognition.

# Identify options for face detection analysis and identification

## Unit 2: Describe considerations for face analysis

There are **two Azure AI services** that you can use to build solutions that detect faces or people in images.

![Github Logo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/face-options.png)

## The Azure AI Vision service

The Azure AI Vision service enables you to detect people in an image, as well as returning a bounding box for its location.

## The Face service

The Face service offers more comprehensive facial analysis capabilities than the Azure AI Vision service, including:

- Face detection (with bounding box).
- Comprehensive facial feature analysis (including head postMessage, presence of spectacles, blur, facial landmarks, occlusion and others).
- Face comparison and verification.
- Facial recognition

# Unit 3

# - Understand Consideration for Face Analysis

While all application of artificial intelligence require considerations for responsible and ethical use, system that rely on facial data can be particularly problematic.

When building a solution that uses facial data, considerations include: (but aren't limited to):

- _Data privacy and sercurity_: Facial data is personally indentiable, and should be considered sensitive and private. You should ensure that you have implemented adequate protection for facial data use for model training and inferencing.
- _Transparency_. Ensure that users are informed about how their facial data is used, and who will have access to it.
- _Fairness and inclusiveness_. Ensure that your face-based system can't be used in manner that is prejudicial to individuals based on their appearance, or to unfairly target individuals.

# Unit 4

# - Detect Faces with the Azure AI Vision Service

To detect and analyze faces with the Azure AI Vision service, call the Analyze Image function(SDK or equivalent REST method), specifying People as one of the visual features to be returned.

In images that contain one or more people, the response includes details of their location in the image and the attributes of the detected person, like this:

```js
{
  "modelVersion": "2023-10-01",
  "metadata": {
    "width": 400,
    "height": 600
  },
  "peopleResult": {
    "values": [
      {
        "boundingBox": {
          "x": 0,
          "y": 56,
          "w": 101,
          "h": 189
        },
        "confidence": 0.9474349617958069
      },
      {
        "boundingBox": {
          "x": 402,
          "y": 96,
          "w": 124,
          "h": 156
        },
        "confidence": 0.9310565276194865
      },
    ...
    ]
  }
}
```

# Unit 5

# Understand capabilites of the Face service

The **Face Service** provides comprehensive _facial detection, analysis, and recognition capablities_.
![Github Logo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/face-service.png)

The **Face Service** provides functionality that you can use for:

- **Face detection**: for each detected FontFace, the results include an ID that identifies the face and the bounding box coordinates indicating its location in the image.
- **Facial attribute analysis**: you can return a wide range of facial attributes, including:
  - Head pose (pitch, roll, and yaw orientation in 3D space).
  - Glasses (NoGlasses, ReadingGlasses, Sunglasses, or SwimmingGoggles).
  - Blur (low, medium, or high).
  - Exposure (underExposure, goodExposure, or overExposure).
  - Noise (visual noise in the image).
  - Occlusion (objects obscuring the face).
  - Accessories (glasses, headwear, mask).
  - QualityForRecognition (low, medium, or High)
- **Facial landmark location**: coordinates for key landmarks in relation to facial features (for example, eye corners, pupils, tip of nose, and so on)
- **Face comparison**: you can compare faces across multiple images for similarity (to find individuals with similar facial features) and verification (to determine that a face in one image is the same person as a face in another image)
- **Facial Liveness**: liveness can be used to determine if the input video is a real stream or a fake to prevent bad intentioned individuals from spoofing the recognition system.

You can provision Face as a single-service resource, or you can use the Face API in a _multi-service_ **Azure AI Services** resource.

If want to use the identification, recognition, and verification features of Face, you'll need to apply for the _Limited Access policy_ and get approval before these features are available.

# Unit 6

# Compare and match detected faces

When a face is detected by the _Face Service_, an ID is assigned to it and retained in the service resource for 24 hours. The ID is a GUID, with no indication of the individual's identity other than their facial features.

While the detected face ID is cached, subsequent images can be used to compare the new faces to the cached identity and determine if they are similar (in other words, they share similar facial features) or to verify that the same person appears in two images.

![Github Logo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/face-matching.png)

This ability to compare faces anonymously can be useful in systems where it's important to confirm that the same person is present on two ocassions, without the need to know the actual identity of the person. For example, by taking images of people as they enter and leave a secured space to verify that everyone who entered leaves.

# Unit 7

# Implement facial recognition

For scenarios where you need to positively identify individuals, you can train a facial recognition model using face images.

To train a facial recognition model with the Face Service:

1. Create a **Person Group** that defines the set of individuals you want to identify (for example, employees in a company).
2. Add a **Person** to the **Person Group** for each individual you want to identify.
3. Add detected faces from multiple images to each **person**, preferably in various poses. The ID's of these faces will no longer expire after 24 hours (so they're now referred to as _persisted faces_).
4. Train the model.

![Github Logo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-data-ai/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/media/person-groups.png)

The trained model is stored in your Face (or Azure AI Services) resource, and can be used by client applications to:

- Identify individuals in images.
- Verify the identity of a detected face.
- Analyze new images to find faces that are similar to a known, persisted face.
