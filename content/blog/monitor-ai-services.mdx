# Monitor cost

On of the main benefits of using cloud services is that you can gain cost efficiencies by only paying for services as you use them. Some Azure AI services resources offer a free tier with restrictions on use, which is useful for development and testing; and one or more billed tiers that incur charges based on transactions. The specific billing rate depends on the resource type.

# Plan costs for AI services

Before deploying a solution that depends on AI services, you can estimate costs by using the _Azure Pricing Calculator_.

To use the pricing calculator to estimate AI services costs, create a new estimate and select _Azure AI services in the AI + Machine Learning_ category. Then select the specific AI service API you plan to use (for example, _Azure AI Text Analytics_), the region where you plan provision it, and the pricing tier of the instance you plan to use; and fill in the expected usage metrics and support Option. To create an estimate that includes multiple AI services APIs, add additional **Azure AI services** resources to the estimate.

After you've created an estimate, you can save it. You can also export it in the Microsoft Excel format.

# View costs for AI services

In common with other Azure resources, you can view details of accumulated costs for AI services resources, add filter that restricts the data to reflect resources with a service name of Congintive Services.

# Create alerts

Microsoft Azure provides alerting support for resources through the creation of _alert rules_. You use alert rules to configure notifications and alerts for your resources based on events or metrics thresholds. These alerts will ensure that the correct team knows when a problem arises.
