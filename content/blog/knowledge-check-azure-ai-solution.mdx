1. You want to **find information** in Microsoft Word documents that are **stored in Azure Storage Blob** container.
   **What** should you **do to ensure** the files can be **accessed by Azure Ai Search?**

- [x] In an **Azure Ai Services resource**, and **add a data source** that references the container where the files **are stored**.

2. You are **creating an index** that includes a field named **modified_date**. You want to ensure that the **modified_date** field can be included in search results. Which attribute must you apply to the **modified_date** field in the index definition?

- [x] To enable a field to be included in the results, you must take it retrievable.

# Summary

In this module, you learned how to use Azure AI Search to create an AI Search Solution that consists of:

- A **data source** where the data to be indexed is stored (though you can also push data directly into an index by using the API).

- A **Skillset** that defines and enrichment pipeline of cognitive skills to enrich the index data.

- An **index** that defines fields, which the user can query.

- An **indexer** that populates the fields in the index with values extracted from the source data.

Now that you've completed this module, you've learned to:

- **Create an Azure AI Search solution**

- **Develop a search application**.
